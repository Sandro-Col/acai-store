      <h2>Acai is an immune booster.</h2>
      <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 max-w-2xl mx-auto">
        Acai berry is an immune booster. In fact, one study found that the
        compounds in Acai reduced the occurrence of malfunctioning cells by up
        to 86%.
      </p>
      <h2>Acai is jam packed with antioxidants</h2>
      <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 max-w-2xl mx-auto">
        Since the Acai berry is loaded with phytochemicals, they can be useful
        in slowing the ageing process and fighting free radicals in the body.
        While most berries have antioxidants, Acai stands out as one berry has
        ten times as many antioxidants as grapes, and twice as many as
        blueberries. Acai is rich in anthocyanins, polyphenols, vitamins A, C
        and E, so you know you’re doing your body a favour when you snack on an
        Acai bowl or smoothie.
      </p>
      <h2>Acai is rich in electrolytes</h2>
      <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 max-w-2xl mx-auto">
        A day out in the sun and ocean, followed by a big night up in Chora, can
        leave you feeling drained, tired and dehydrated. Fortunately Acai is
        rich in electrolytes as it’s loaded with magnesium, potassium,
        phosphorus and manganese. Say goodbye to muscle cramps, dehydration and
        fatigue!
      </p>
      <h2>Acai is full of trace minerals</h2>
      <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 max-w-2xl mx-auto">If you weren’t already sold, it helps to know that Acai is packed with
      trace minerals that are essential to the body such as iron, calcium,
      copper and zinc. Not only is it full of trace minerals, the Acai berry has
      the right molecular structure to allow your body to absorb all the
      goodness.</p>
      
      <h2>Our Acai or organic and sustainably sourced</h2>
      <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 max-w-2xl mx-auto">
        We are proud to offer organic and sustainably sourced Acai. We import
        our Acai from Amazonia, who work with the indigenous people in Brazil
        and South America to ensure that the Acai you’re enjoying is Fair Trade
        and sustainable.
